h2. Deployment

Once we've "installed Sphinx":installing_sphinx.html and "installed ThinkingSphinx":installing_thinking_sphinx.html on your production server, as well as setting up all of our indexes, we can deploy it to our production servers.


h3. Basics

Essentially, the following steps need to be performed for a deployment:

* stop Sphinx @searchd@ (ensure it's running)
* generate Sphinx configuration
* start Sphinx @searchd@
* ensure index is regularly rebuilt

Configuring Sphinx for our production environment includes setting where the PID file and the index files are stored. In your @config/sphinx.yml@ file, set up the following additional parameters:

{%highlight yaml%}
production:
  pid_file: /path/to/app/shared/tmp/searchd.pid
  searchd_file_path: /path/to/app/shared/db/sphinx
{%endhighlight%}

You'll want to make sure that the application shared folder has @db@ and @tmp@ subdirectories. You'll also want to double check the permissions of these folders so that the user the application and searchd both runs as can write to both folders.

Before deploying, we generally assume that the Sphinx @searchd@ search daemon is running. You may need to manually configure and run the daemon the first deployment with ThinkingSphinx support added.


h3. Deploying With Capistrano

Deploying via Capistrano is simplified by the included recipe file that comes with the ThinkingSphinx plugin.

The first step is to include the recipe in order to define the necessary tasks for us:

{%highlight ruby%}
# If you're using Thinking Sphinx as a gem:
require 'thinking_sphinx/deploy/capistrano'
# If you're using Thinking Sphinx as a plugin:
require 'vendor/plugins/thinking-sphinx/recipes/thinking_sphinx'
{%endhighlight%}

Now we can define our callbacks in order to make sure that Sphinx is properly configured, indexed, and started on each deploy:

{%highlight ruby%}
task :before_update_code, :roles => [:app] do
  thinking_sphinx.stop
end

task :symlink_sphinx_indexes, :roles => [:app] do
  run "ln -nfs #{shared_path}/db/sphinx #{release_path}/db/sphinx"
end

task :after_update_code, :roles => [:app] do
  symlink_sphinx_indexes
  thinking_sphinx.configure
  thinking_sphinx.start
end
{%endhighlight%}

The above makes sure we stop the Sphinx @searchd@ search daemon before we update the code. After the code is updated, we reconfigure Sphinx and then restart. We'll setup a @cron@ job next to keep the indexes up-to-date.


h3. Regularly Rebuilding the Index

One of the side effects of the Sphinx indexing methodology is that it is necessary to constantly rebuild the index in order to be able to search with recent changes. In order to do this, we set up a @cron@ job to run the appropriate command.

In your @/etc/crontab@ file, add the following line to the bottom:

{%highlight bash%}
0 * * * * deploy  cd /path/to/app/current && /usr/local/bin/rake thinking_sphinx:index RAILS_ENV=production
{%endhighlight%}
