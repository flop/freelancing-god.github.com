h2. Installing Thinking Sphinx

There's a few different ways you can get Thinking Sphinx installed into your web application. I recommend installing as a gem (and indeed, if you're using Merb, then you'll have to use the gem). If you're using Rails and prefer a plugin, read through the options further down the page.

*Please note*: If you're using Sphinx 0.9.9 (as opposed to 0.9.8), then you'll want to download the "sphinx-0.9.9 branch":http://github.com/freelancing-god/thinking-sphinx/tree/sphinx-0.9.9 from the GitHub repository, or use "the 099 gem":http://gemcutter.org/gems/thinking-sphinx-099 (see below).

h3. As a Gem

There's a few steps to using Thinking Sphinx as a gem. Firstly, let's install it from "GemCutter":http://gemcutter.org/gems/thinking-sphinx:

{% highlight sh %}
sudo gem install thinking-sphinx \
  --source http://gemcutter.org
{% endhighlight %}

If you're using Sphinx 0.9.9, then make sure you grab the "099 version":http://gemcutter.org/gems/thinking-sphinx-099 instead:

{% highlight sh %}
sudo gem install thinking-sphinx-099 \
  --source http://gemcutter.org
{% endhighlight %}

It's recommended to *not* install both versions of the library - choose a version, and stick with it.

If you're using Merb, then you just need to require the library within your @init.rb@:

{% highlight ruby %}
require 'thinking_sphinx'
{% endhighlight %}

For Rails users, you'll need to add the gem to your configuration setup in @environment.rb@:

{% highlight ruby %}
config.gem(
  'thinking-sphinx',
  :lib     => 'thinking_sphinx',
  :version => '1.2.12'
)
{% endhighlight %}

Again, if you're using Sphinx 0.9.9, set the gem name appropriately.

{% highlight ruby %}
config.gem(
  'thinking-sphinx-099',
  :lib     => 'thinking_sphinx',
  :version => '1.2.12'
)
{% endhighlight %}

And one last thing: ensure the rake tasks are available by adding the following line to your @Rakefile@:

{% highlight ruby %}
require 'thinking_sphinx/tasks'
{% endhighlight %}

h3. As a Plugin with Rails 2.1 or newer and Git

If you've got @git@ installed, and are using Rails 2.1 or newer, then it's painless to get Thinking Sphinx installed in your Rails application:

{% highlight sh %}
script/plugin install \
  git://github.com/freelancing-god/thinking-sphinx.git
{% endhighlight %}

h3. As a Plugin with Rails 2.0 or older and Git

If you've got @git@, but using one of the older versions of Rails, then things are slightly more complicated.

{% highlight sh %}
git clone \
  git://github.com/freelancing-god/thinking-sphinx.git \
  vendor/plugins/thinking_sphinx
{% endhighlight %}

And if you want to make sure it all gets committed to git as part of your main repository, don't forget to remove the plugin's .git directory.

{% highlight sh %}
rm -r vendor/plugins/thinking_sphinx/.git
{% endhighlight %}

h3. As a Plugin without Git

If you don't have @git@ installed, all is not lost. You can either manually download the tarball from GitHub, and then extract it into your @vendor/plugins@ directory, or you can run the following shell commands from the root of your Rails application, which do exactly the same thing.

{% highlight sh %}
curl -L \
  http://github.com/freelancing-god/thinking-sphinx/tarball/master \
  -o thinking-sphinx.tar.gz
tar -xvf thinking-sphinx.tar.gz -C vendor/plugins
mv vendor/plugins/freelancing-god-thinking-sphinx* \
  vendor/plugins/thinking-sphinx
rm thinking-sphinx.tar.gz
{% endhighlight %}
