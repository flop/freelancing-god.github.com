h2. Installing Thinking Sphinx

There's a few different ways you can get Thinking Sphinx installed into your web application. If you're using Rails, read through the first few options. If you're using Merb, then the gem is the best way to go - scroll down a bit for those instructions.

*Please note*: If you're using Sphinx 0.9.9 (as opposed to 0.9.8), then you'll want to download the "sphinx-0.9.9 branch":http://github.com/freelancing-god/thinking-sphinx/tree/sphinx-0.9.9 from the GitHub repository.

h3. Rails 2.1 or newer and Git

If you've got @git@ installed, and are using Rails 2.1 or newer, then it's painless to get Thinking Sphinx installed in your Rails application:

{% highlight sh %}
script/plugin install \
  git://github.com/freelancing-god/thinking-sphinx.git
{% endhighlight %}

h3. Rails 2.0 or older and Git

If you've got @git@, but using one of the older versions of Rails, then things are slightly more complicated.

{% highlight sh %}
git clone \
  git://github.com/freelancing-god/thinking-sphinx.git \
  vendor/plugins/thinking_sphinx
{% endhighlight %}

And if you want to make sure it all gets committed to git as part of your main repository, don't forget to remove the plugin's .git directory.

{% highlight sh %}
rm -r vendor/plugins/thinking_sphinx/.git
{% endhighlight %}

h3. Without Git

If you don't have @git@ installed, all is not lost. You can either manually download the tarball from GitHub, and then extract it into your @vendor/plugins@ directory, or you can run the following shell commands from the root of your Rails application, which do exactly the same thing.

{% highlight sh %}
curl -L \
  http://github.com/freelancing-god/thinking-sphinx/tarball/master \
  -o thinking-sphinx.tar.gz
tar -xvf thinking-sphinx.tar.gz -C vendor/plugins
mv vendor/plugins/freelancing-god-thinking-sphinx* \
  vendor/plugins/thinking-sphinx
rm thinking-sphinx.tar.gz
{% endhighlight %}

h3. As a Gem

There's a few steps to using Thinking Sphinx as a gem. Firstly, let's install it from GitHub:

{% highlight sh %}
sudo gem install freelancing-god-thinking-sphinx \
  --source http://gems.github.com
{% endhighlight %}

If you're using Merb, then you just need to require the library within your @init.rb@:

{% highlight ruby %}
require 'thinking_sphinx'
{% endhighlight %}

For Rails users, you'll need to add the gem to your configuration setup in @environment.rb@:

{% highlight ruby %}
config.gem(
  'freelancing-god-thinking-sphinx',
  :lib         => 'thinking_sphinx',
  :version     => '1.1.12'
)
{% endhighlight %}

And one last thing: ensure the rake tasks are available by adding the following line to your @Rakefile@:

{% highlight ruby %}
require 'thinking_sphinx/tasks'
{% endhighlight %}
